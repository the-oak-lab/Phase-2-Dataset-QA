## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Load the tidyverse (including ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
# Upload data from GitHub
dat <- read_tsv("ds5836_student_step_All_Data_8152_2023_1214_080108.txt") %>% janitor::clean_names()
final_dat <- read_tsv("final_data_testing.txt") %>% janitor::clean_names()
```
```{r}
glimpse(final_dat)
```
```{r}
# remove unnecessary columns to reduce noise
clear_final_dat <- final_dat |> 
  select(-sample, -step_start_time, -first_transaction_time, -correct_transaction_time, -correct_step_duration_sec, -step_end_time, -step_duration_sec, -error_step_duration_sec)

# count the number of observations for each condition
# clear_final_dat |> 
#   group_by(condition) |> 
#   summarize(observations = n()) 
  
clear_final_dat |> 
  group_by(condition == "Low Learning objective spacing (Learning objective spacing)~~Low Question variability (Question variability)~~Low Topic spacing (Topic spacing)
") 
  
```
## Descriptive Analysis
What is the distribution of students across different conditions (combinations of LO spacing, question variability, and topic spacing)?
```{r}
data_with_counts <- final_dat %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  summarise(student_count = n_distinct(anon_student_id)) %>%
  ungroup()
  
final_dat |>
  mutate()
  ggplot(aes(x = data_with_counts)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 5, fill = "skyblue") +
  facet_wrap(vars(condition)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Students Across Different Conditions",
       x = "Students",
       y = "Count")
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
