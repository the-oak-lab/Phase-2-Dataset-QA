## QA (Quality Assurance) Check on Phase 2 Data

### Description

This repository contains a quality assurance check on the most recent (6/11) Phase 2 dataset, where I used exploratory data analyses methods in R to check that all conditions that were supposed to happen happened, that participants completed all conditions (and how many didn't), how many trials per condition per participant, that there is pre-post for all conditions for all participants (and how for how many there isn't), etc. 

### Repository Contents:

- R Markdown ("Phase 2 dataset QA.Rmd") 
***ignore "Oaklabpt1.Rmd" that is a random testing file***
